    "Translating games into computer code is an excellent way to naturally bring together many programming topics.  Because games are typically played in rounds, a repeative operation (like a loop) is often required, and in each turn there are many possible actions, requiring the use of conditional statements.\n",

    "- Everyone must complete Pig, and one more of your choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing any code, **grab some dice and play the game a few times!**  Make sure you understand the mechanics of the game *before you write any code*.  Think carefully about decomposing the problems into multiple functions. Some functions might be unique to an individual game, but they could help you manage the task. Some functions may be reusable in multiple programs. Some of these might be:\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1) Beat It\n",
    "\n",
    "- This game is played with two players and two dice.\n",
    "- Each time the dice are rolled, the numbers on the dice are concatenated such that the larger roll becomes the 10’s place and the smaller roll becomes the one’s place. \n",
    "    - For instance, a roll of a `3` and a `6` would become `63`\n",
    "    - In the event that both dice are the same, the same digit is recorded for the 10’s place and the 1’s place.\n",
    "- In each round, players alternate rolling the dice, as long as they have a higher number.\n",
    "- The player that has the highest roll for the round gets their points added to their score.\n",
    "- In the event of a tie, neither player gets any points for that round.\n",
    "- The game ends when one of the players reaches 100 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Keep the Lowest\n",
    "\n",
    "- This game is played with two players and five dice.\n",
    "- Players take turns rolling and selecting dice.\n",
    "- The dice are rolled and the player *keeps* the lowest, removing one dice from play.\n",
    "- The player's score is the sum of all their *kept* dice.\n",
    "- The first player to reach a score of 20 **loses**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3) High/Low\n",
    "\n",
    "- This game is played with one players and two dice.\n",
    "- The player starts with \\$100 in their account.\n",
    "- Each round, the user places a wager and a bet\n",
    "    - The wager is at least \\$1, but not *more* than their account balance.\n",
    "    - The only allowable bets are: \n",
    "        - High  (above 7)\n",
    "        - Low   (below 7)\n",
    "        - Seven (exactly 7)\n",
    "- The player rolls a pair of dice.\n",
    "- A roll is Low if the total of the dice is 2,3,4,5,6;\n",
    "- A roll is High if the total is 8,9,10,11,12\n",
    "- Matching Low or High pays out 2:1\n",
    "- Matching a 7 pays out 4:1\n",
    "- No match results in the bet being deducted from the account.\n",
    "- Display the current account balance at the end of each round.\n",
    "- The game ends when the user has gone bust (no money) or has earned \\$250.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4) Roll the Bones\n",
    "\n",
    "- This game is played with one player and two dice.\n",
    "- The player enters a guess between 5 and 30.\n",
    "- The player rolls a set of five dice and accumulates the total.\n",
    "- When the guess is less than the total, award `guess-5` points to the player (this rewards risk taking).\n",
    "- When the guess is too high, penalize the player `5-guess` points. \n",
    "- For example:\n",
    "    - If the player guess `13` and the roll is `25`, the player wins `8 points. \n",
    "    - If the guess was `18` and the roll is `17`, the user earns `-13` points.\n",
    "- When you guess the total exactly, the player is awarded 50 points.\n",
    "- Keep track of the total number of points and the average points per turn.\n",
    "- The game continues until the user wishes to stop."
